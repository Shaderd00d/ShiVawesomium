Read the Awesomium license at http://wiki.awesomium.com/licensing/licensing-overview.html

## Description ##
This is a plugin framework to integrate the Awesomium SDK (http://www.awesomium.com/) into the Shiva 3D game engine. Using this plugin, it's possible to display web content on Shiva pixelmaps. These pixelmaps can be used on scene objects and HUD Components.
In its current state, this project contains basic mouse and keyboard input for HUD components.

## Versions ##
* Awesomium 1.7.5.1
* Shiva 1.9.2

## Setup ##
### Windows ###
Follow the setup instructions at http://wiki.awesomium.com/getting-started/setting-up-on-windows.html, but skip the point "Set up your project". Copy the files named under "Copy files to your build distribution" into the Plugins\com.shaderman.awesomium\Contents\Windows folder. Also skip the part "Include the API", it's already in the project.

### Linux ###
The project has a Makefile included. I've already built for Linux, but don't have instructions for you (yet).

### Mac OSX ###
Xocde project included. I've already built for OSX, but don't have instructions for you (yet).
